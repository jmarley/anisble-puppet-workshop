= Ansible and Puppet workshop

Basically, I want to show case a simple comparison between the two tools for installing an existing rpm and configuring it. My intuition is that they will function very similarily and with similar difficulties setting up.

== Use Case

''''
I have a custom rpm that I want installed, but the rpm needs individual configurations per project that is installing it. Generally if it was the same across the board we would simple write an rpm and be done with, however it is not that easy if there are configuration variations between consumers. We are going to simulate this variation by doing the configurations with configuration management tool.

''''


.What we're going to do
. Build a custom RPM and repository for EAP installation on RHEL 7
. Use configuration management tool to install and configure EAP on RHEL 7

== The  RPM
On the host machine download this project and then build the rpm and create the repository. We will then use this to push to the remote server for installation.

. Download project

. https://www.jboss.org/download-manager/file/jboss-eap-6.4.0.GA.zip[Download EAP]

. Add product to installs directory

. Create link to installs directory

[source,bash]
----
$ cd /<project-home>/ansible-puppet-workshop
$ ln installs/jboss-eap-6.4.0.zip support/rpmbuild/SOURCES
----

[start=5]
. Build RPM

[source, bash]
----
$ rpmbuild --define "_topdir ${PWD}/support/rpmbuild" -ba ./support/rpmbuild/SPECS/jboss-eap-6.4.spec
----

== Ansible

.run ansible file

[source,bash]
----
$ ansible -i hosts ./ansible-puppet-workshop/ansible/add_eap_rpm_play.yml
----

.verify anisble ran correctly

http://minion01.rhel7.labs:8080/jboss-helloworld-ansible - visit hellow world app deployed on my server!

NOTE: my rhel server is minion01.rhel7.labs, but your server will be different

.remove ansible configurations
[source,bash]
----
$ ansible -i hosts rm_eap_rpm_play.yml
----

== Puppet

.puppet master configuration

. Add environment path to puppet master
[source,bash]
----
$ vim /etc/puppet/puppet.conf

[main]
   environmentpath = $confdir/environments:/opt/puppet/environments
----

. Mount projects environments folder

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir -p /opt/puppet/environments
$ mount --bind <location-to-project>/ansible-puppet-workshop/puppet/environments /opt/puppet/environments
----


.install eap 6

. On agent add install environment 

[source,bash]
----
$  sudo vim /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
[main]
...
...
[agent]
    environment = install
----


.verify puppet ran correctly

http://minion01.rhel7.labs:8080/jboss-helloworld-puppet - visit hellow world app deployed on my server!

NOTE: my rhel server is minion01.rhel7.labs, but your server will be different

.remove eap 6

. On agent add remove environment 

[source,bash]
----
$  sudo vim /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
[main]
...
...
[agent]
    environment = remove
